A question and answer platform, similar with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but for economists: built with Python and JavaScript. The Tech Stack is as follows:

2. Django REST framework 
3. JavaScript 
4. BootStrap5
5. Auth0

This site is hosted on Heroku: which you can find [here](https://nesaacademy.herokuapp.com/). Here are the basic features.
