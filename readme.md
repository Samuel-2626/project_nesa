# Welcome to Nesa Academy

![Homepage](https://imgur.com/r7UZJb6.png)

A question and answer platform, similar with [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), but for economists: built with Python and JavaScript. The Tech Stack is as follows:

1. Django 
2. Django REST framework 
3. JavaScript 
4. BootStrap5
5. Auth0

This site is hosted on Heroku: which you can find [here](https://nesaacademy.herokuapp.com/). Here are the basic features.

## Authentication

Nesa Academy authentication was built with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) and it only allows social authentication with a Google account.

### A Single Question

Things start getting interesting when you view a single question, as you can see when it was asked, how many times it was viewed, and how many answers it as. You can also `share`, `follow`, `upvote`, and `downvote` a question. While if there are related questions, it will also be visible here.

Futhermore, you can answer a particular question, just once as well as `upvote`, `downvote`, `edit`, and `delete` answer. You can also `accept` a particular answer if you deemed it to be the most suitable for your particular question: a `green check mark` will be visible on accepted answers.
